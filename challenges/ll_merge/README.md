# Merge 2 Linked Lists
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Worked with Ting

## Challenge

Zip merge 2 linked lists alternating nodes from each list

## Approach & Efficiency

Ting and I approached this by using a while loop to go through the lists, and alternate which node was being pointed to, representing one list's node pointing to a node in the other list and so on.
