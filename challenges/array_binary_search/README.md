# array-binary-search

**Author**: Raven Delaney
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for a Code Fellows 401 class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->
Using big O notation, find the index of a list element that matches a search term

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->
Will need python 3(or nearest equivalent to run)
As this exists primarily to test the function than as its own program, my suggestion would be to run it as pytest
In command line, go to pipenv shell
Once in the shell, install the pytest dependencies
Type pytest and hit enter/return
You should then see the results of the test suite.
You could also use this to test different arrays and target values.

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. This is also an area which you can include any visuals; flow charts, example usage gifs, screen captures, etc.-->
Python 3
Pipenv
Command Line
Pytest

## API
<!-- Provide detailed instructions for your applications usage. This should include any methods or endpoints available to the user/client/developer. Each section should be formatted to provide clear syntax for usage, example calls including input data requirements and options, and example responses or return values. -->
