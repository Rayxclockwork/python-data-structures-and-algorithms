# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Introduction to Hashtables as a data structure

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement a hashtable and nodes containing key-value pairs, and associated methods
Test those implementations

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Big O of time is O(1)
Big O of space (as with all linked lists) is O(n)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
Class of Hashtables
Methods of -
   #### add: takes in key and value; hashes the key and adds key/value pair to table
   #### get: takes in key and returns value from pair
   #### contains: takes in key and returns boolean indicating if key is in the table
   #### hash: takes in key and returns index
