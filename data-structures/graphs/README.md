Introduction to Graphs data structure

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Using a graphs data structure, methods will add nodes, add edges, traverse using breadth first, and return if a set of nodes are traversable and, based on weight, what the 'trip' will 'cost'

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Big O of get_edges is O(n squared)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in your Graph -->
add_node
size
add_edge
get_nodes
get_ neighbors
breadth_first
get_edges

classes - Graph, Vertex, and Queue
